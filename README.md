# Usecase
This is a usecase to develop an algorithm that aims to generate appropriate responses to a feedback. The approach was to develop a hybrid model leveraging both the abilities of NLP and Rule-based models. 

# Files 

## Notebooks
UsecaseSentimentAnalysis.ipynb : Full data and model analysis for sentiment Analysis 

UseCaseNER.ipynb : Full data and model analysis for Name Entity Recognition

UseCaseFunc.ipynb : The needed functions to run the algorithm ( input preprocess, traing and predicting for both previous models )

UseCaseOutput.ipynb : where all the functions will work together to deliver the final output. 

Side Note: training should happen before executing the final algorithm: Run all the cells in UseCaseOutput.ipynb

## Datasets
Restaurant_Reviews.csv : Sentiment Analysis Dataset

training_NER.json: NER dataset for sensitive topics extraction (POC)
